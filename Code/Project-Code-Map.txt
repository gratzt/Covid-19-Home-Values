Steps necessary to reproduce the project deliverables from the coding perspective

1) acs_build.py
	* This file pulls in the 2019 Data Profile variables from the American Communities Survey API 
        and does some minimal cleaning. It relies on the acs5_2019_dict dictionary from the proj_globals.py file
        and the dppull function from the ACS_DataProfile_APIPull.py files.

2) Build_Zip_School_Crosswalk.py
	* This file takes in NCES EDGE data, Common Core Data, and TigerLines Zip Code shape files. It computes the 
        distance between each school and each zip code. It then links the closest elementary, middle, and high
        schools to a zip code.

3) cleancommoncore.py
	* This file takes in the directory, membership, lunch, staff, and school characteristic data from the
        2019 Common Core Data and cleans and merges them into one analytic file. 

4) Assemble_2019_CrossSectional.py
	* This combines the Data Profile tables from the five year estimates of American
	  Communities Survey data (2019), with Common Core data from the 2018-19 school
	  year, and Rural Urban Commuting Area codes. All data are mapped to a zip code.	
	  The final output is a single observation per zip code.
